# FastPay UI Issues Analysis

## Contrast Issues Found:

### Guest Mode Page (/auth/guest):
1. **Input field placeholder text**: The placeholder "Enter your name for the demo" appears to have poor contrast against the light blue background of the input field
2. **Label text**: "Your Name" label appears to have adequate contrast but could be improved
3. **Warning text**: The yellow warning box text appears readable but could be enhanced

## Light/Dark Mode Issues:
- Need to check if there's a theme toggle and test both modes
- Current page appears to be in light mode only

## Input Field Issues:
- No visible icon overlap issue on this page, but need to check other pages with search bars

## Next Steps:
- Test entering guest mode to see dashboard
- Check for theme toggle functionality
- Examine search bars throughout the app
- Look for nigeriaData.ts usage
- Check settings page for currency options



## Dashboard Page Analysis (/dashboard):

### Contrast Issues Found:
1. **Search bar placeholder**: "Search transactions..." placeholder text has poor contrast against the light background
2. **Theme toggle button**: Found a theme toggle button (index 7) - need to test dark mode
3. **Currency display**: Shows â‚¦ (Naira) symbol but need to check if currency conversion works

### Input Field Issues:
1. **Search bar**: The search input field (index 6) appears to have placeholder text but no visible icon overlap issue in current view
